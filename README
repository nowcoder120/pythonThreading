This project will hopefully teach me the basics of python classes, objects, 
and threading.

The fuctionality of this project is to read in any number of separate files, then
spin off the that same number of threads and have them safely write out to the 
same file one line at a time.

If any exceptions are caught while trying to write to the file, the thread 
releases the lock and exits.
